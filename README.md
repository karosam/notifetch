# notifetch

Just another fetch scri....

Wait, no it isn't

It's a fetch script, but with a notification!



## Requirements

* Nerd Fonts in dunstrc config (or change the icons in the script to suitable ones)

## To-do list

* Improve script speed(Right now execute time is 150-300ms, would love to decrease that to max 200ms)




If you have any requests or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or PR and i'll look into it.
